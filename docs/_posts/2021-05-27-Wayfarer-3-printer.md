I've now fully dismantled the dot matrix printer on the Wayfarer 3.

As you can see in the below photo with the Ink 'bobbin' removed there are two 7-pin heads in a fixed position.

Each pin requires 12v to drive. It is a DP820-12LL manufactured by Star Micronics Ltd.

Unfortunately when testing each one I have found some of them to not work, even after a bit of disassembly, cleaning and lubrication. Will have to resort to Plan B...
