This is my first post on the Wayfarer 3! A bus ticket machine built by MDL in the 1990s?

I purchased mine from eBay for Â£20 last week and plan to get it working again keeping the body, LCD, keypad and dot-matrix printer but with new internals that I can customize.

The first step was to crack open the machine to see what was inside and give it a good clean on the way...

This is the leaking battery which I have now removed from the board:
