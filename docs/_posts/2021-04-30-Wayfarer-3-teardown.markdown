This is my first post on the Wayfarer 3! A bus ticket machine that is over 30 years old. It cost Â£20 from eBay and plan I to get it working again keeping the body, LCD, keypad and printer. I will modernize the internals so that I can customize it's functionality.

The first step was to crack open the machine to see what was inside, it was covered in dust everywhere...

This is the leaking battery which I have now removed from the board:

They are connected to the board with a two ribbon cables, backlight connector and the other cable is for the hole punch.

The Wayfarer 3 uses a RFID module to load the routes and store data, here is the board:
